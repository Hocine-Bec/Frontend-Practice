# 🚀 Frontend Learning Projects

Welcome to my personal repository of frontend development projects!

This repo is a growing collection of web development projects I've built while following online courses, tutorials, and hands-on practice sessions. It represents my journey as I learn and grow into a skilled frontend developer.


## 📚 About This Repo

This repository is not tied to any single course, instructor, or platform. It's a space where I:

- Apply what I learn from different online resources
- Build real-world layouts and components
- Experiment with new technologies
- Track my progress over time

Each folder in this repo contains a standalone project with its own structure and purpose — from simple static pages to interactive apps.


## 🛠️ Technologies Included

As I grow, so will this list:

- ✅ **HTML**
- ✅ **CSS**
- 🔄 **JavaScript**
- 🔄 **Responsive Design**
- 🔄 **React.js**
- 🔄 **Tailwind CSS**
- 🔄 **Frontend Frameworks** (e.g., Next.js, Vue) *(coming soon)*
- 🔧 **APIs**, **Git**, **Tooling** *(as needed)*


## 🗂️ Project Structure

Projects are organized by number and title for clarity and versioning:

```
Frontend-Learning/
├── Project-001-Basic-Website/

│
├── Project-002-Responsive-Landing/

```

Each project may include:

- `README.md` (project-specific info)
- Source files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)
- Assets (images, fonts, etc.)


## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

This repo is my personal sandbox. Its goals:

- Reinforce concepts through practice
- Develop a strong understanding of core frontend tools
- Build a foundation for real-world development
- Reflect learning milestones over time


## 🔗 Future Plans

As I learn and build more, I plan to:

- Add advanced projects using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Organize by categories (UI components, full apps, etc.)
- Deploy selected projects via GitHub Pages or Vercel
- Open-source reusable components and templates


## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal repo for learning, but feel free to explore, fork, or use the structure for your own journey.
